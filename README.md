My approach to this assignment was a input validation list solution. Allowing me to vaildate each use case one by one independently. This also made it easier to isloate post/ response and errors. I was able to add error handling in my program for navigation,funtionality,bad characters. Unfortunitly I ran out of time and wasnt able to build full test reporting feature.    



Ideas for improvment:

- Automaticly passing URLs (ex.DECK_ID) values from response
- Adding CI / Devops pipeline 
- Better validation logic, wasnt able to finish unit test repoting logic.
